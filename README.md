## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Angular] - JS library

### What I learned

CSS is not my strong skill, I have used flexbox and grid in the past but it was already predefined in the project and I was mostly replicating what I saw. This time I had to do it by own, althought is not perfect it was a good start to understand how it works.
I used angular since I'm mostly familair with the framework.

### Continued development

I need to continue working with flexbox. Building a little more complex UI components. 
I would like to start working with SCSS and theming.

### Useful resources

- [css tricks - Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand basic concepts of flexbox.
